# Polymath-Studio One-Handed Keyboard

## Description

Type with only one hand

Designed around 1) the most common letters used, 2) relationships between sounds, 3) the shape of a left hand, 4) practicality, the PS-OHK (pronounced "psawk" [p͡sɑk̚]) aims to be the ultimate one-handed typing experience all without special modifiers (a standard key count) and a layout that is relatively easy to get used to.
